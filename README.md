## Purpose

This project was created to:
- Demonstrate a concept for a music-for-animation platform
- Showcase modern UI trends (glass-morphism, soft gradients, micro-interactions)
- Provide a starting point for developers building similar creative tools

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/animate-tune.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Click around to explore the interactive elements (buttons show simulated responses)

No build process or dependencies required – it's pure frontend.
